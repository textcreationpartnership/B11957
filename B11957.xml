            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <q>What shall it profit a man if he shall gaine the whole world, and lose his owne soule.</q>
            <p>A text, were I to name, me thinkes, I might most properly; <hi>Gods valuation of mans soule.</hi> For the better understanding of which, observe with me two generalls: <hi>Formam et Materiam,</hi> or, if you will, a fourefold question in this one, wherein are remarkeable,
<list>
                  <item>1. The manner of speech Christ here useth?</item>
                  <item>2. What we are to understand by the world?</item>
                  <item>3. What by the soule?</item>
                  <item>4. And lastly what it is for a man to loose his soule?</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And of these in their order, and first of the former; what is that manner of speech Christ here useth? Even a most piercing, a most pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall interrogation: <hi>as a nayle</hi> not onely <hi>fastened,</hi> but driven (even to the head) <hi>by the Masters</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccles. 12. 11.</note>

               <hi>of the assemblies.</hi> It is not <hi>quantum,</hi> but <hi>quid:</hi> not how much, but how little, or rather indeed, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all will it profit any. So is it, I reade, Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> renders, and expounds, that of<note place="margin">Psal. 130. 3.</note> the Prophet: <hi>O Lord if thou markest injqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> there is none would bee able to stand. May we not as fitly then determine, of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours question; and conclude, as if he had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 17, 18.</note> affirmatively, (as he was wont) and said; veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly verily it cannot possiblie any thing profit any man to gaine the world. And that (as you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member) a second question to be resolved, even what it is we are here to understand by the world. For, as it is of a most capatious figure, according to Philosophy; so is it not uncapable of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold acceptations, according to Divinitie, then is <hi>orbis interior, exterior</hi> and <hi>superior:</hi> then is <hi>mundus continens,</hi> such as is the whole fabricke of<note place="margin">Iohn 1. 10. Heb. 11. 3.</note> heaven and earth: and there is <hi>mundus contentus;</hi> and of this there is both <hi>Flos et Fex;</hi> as it were,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 12.</note> in meale, both floure and branne: as are Angells<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 19. 1 Iohn 5. 19.</note> both good and bad: and of men, whether alive or dead, both Elect and Reprobate: together with all those other, commonly called <hi>Goods of this world,</hi> as are honours, pleasures, and profits of what nature soever. And howsoever, I finde Interpretors, as it were, swimme in one streame this way, yet is it observeable (me thinkes) our Saviour saith not onely, what will it profit a man to gaine the world but (as the Originall hath it) <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>; even <hi>this whole world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that, we may easily cōceive of our Saviours
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:177552:10"/> minde, by his words: which are, of a larger ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, than that they should intend any thing lesse than he spake, whereas he spake as much as if he<note place="margin">Isay 1. 18.</note> had said: <hi>Come and let us reason together.</hi> Is it not so, that he gaines nothing, that gaines this whole world: whether continent or contained, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heaven or earth, Angells or men, honours, pleasures, or profits? For I may suppose, thou mightest have heaven and earth, and yet not bee possessour; otherwise thē is an usurper of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the King himselfe will soone drive out: as a strong man the theefe that comes to spoile him<note place="margin">Luk. 11. 21. &amp;c.</note> of his goods, except it were possible a man might be stronger than his Maker; or an earthen vessell, able to resist the potter: or if you will, I may sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose thou mightest have Heaven and earth, even as madd men have Empires; or that franticke fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, had all shippes at sea, by imagination onely.

Which, as it was a third terme, I propounded to be explicated; so am I now come to expound it. I confesse, it is promiscuously taken in scripture, some times for<note place="margin">Psal. 7. 2.

               <note place="margin">Iohn 14. 6.</note> it will nothing profit them, though they gaine the world, yet if they forfeit (as it were their soule by sinne. And of this (as a quintessentiall truth arising from our determination of those foure former questions) it is I must now treate.</p>

               <hi>there is no man can utter it:</hi> and if so, what then are those things, all or most men magnifie so much? what are riches? what are honours? but even va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of vanities &amp; vexation of vaine spirits?

As <hi>Iobs</hi> freinds, are they not <hi>miserable comforters:</hi> since it is not in the power of a purple gowne, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue any mans backe from a-like-spotted-fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: no more than can a crowne of gold, cure the head-ach: or a Noble Garter, prevent the gout. And are Honours a lesse vanity, thinke you, or a lesse vexation? How ordinarily may wee see, the greatest Favorites sometimes vp, and somtimes downe, tossed, as it were bals at <hi>Tennis?</hi> Even when as they are at the highest, how are they faine to borrow other mens imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, to thinke themselves happie? Many might I recount, and speake of: whose Moone hath beene eclypsed at the full, and their Sunne set at Nooneday. But of all, memorable (me thinkes) is the storie of <hi>Haman:</hi> who sets, and feasts to day with the King and the Queene: yet to morrow is hee hung vp, for food (as it were) unto the fowles of the ayre.

            <p>Which, if there be any desire to know, what it is: I must needs answere such a man, as one did him; who would needs know, what God was give me time, and I will tell thee: and when hee asked him againe and againe; still, give me time, and I will tell thee. For, no more, then the eye of man can see it selfe; no more is it possible our understanding should ever understand it selfe. And yet if it may suffice, to describe that, I may not define; The Soule it is a substance, invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<note place="margin">A Description of mans soule.</note> and spirituall indivisible and incorporeall, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible and eternall—<hi>plena Deo, similis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Creanti:</hi> saith <hi>Prudentius. St. Bernard,</hi> doubts not to say; It is not so much a heavenly Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, as heaven it selfe, in substance. And <hi>St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin,</hi> he compares it, to that blessed Trinity; for as there are three in one, and one in three: so are there in the Soule of man three Faculties and yet
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:177552:14"/> but one Soule: Three in one and one in three: though, I must confesse, betwixt the former, and this latter; God and our Soules, there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible distance of glory. Very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then have acknowledged it a Particle of Divine Breath, a branch of the Deity, not to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with any thing (as <hi>Cicero</hi> thinks) except God himselfe. But of all, me thinkes, a moderne wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our owne, most emphatically calls it; a Riverling of that divine Spring, who brake not his selfe-essence or Triple-vnity, yet afforded us this portion: even breathed into man these pure qualities. Of which before we speake, forasmuch as the worke is oftentimes esteemed the more, for the workemans sake: give me leave, to put you in minde, the Authour of them was God.<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 7.</note> And was not hee the creatour of the world also? True: but after a different manner, matter, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell, made he man. For it is observable; God spake the word, and the very heavens they were<note place="margin">Psal. 33. 6.</note> made: he commanded and they were created: he<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 3.</note> sayed but, let there be light, and there was light. I will not trouble you, with that perplexed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie of the Schoole: whether by light wee are to understand the Angells, yea or no? suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent it may bee, that if so: then were the Angells themselves created, by the speaking of one word: &amp; that word was (as Divines say) but a thought of the Deity. Which being about to make man,<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 26.</note> how doth it goe about (as it were) to call a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell: Let us make man, yea and in our image, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our likenesse. So created God man in his own
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:177552:14"/> Image (saith <hi>Moses</hi>) in the Image of God created he him. The Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrills the breath of life, and man became a living Soule.<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 7.</note> now who knowes not, it is the glory of an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly King; not to stampe with his Image or envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone with his superscription any peece, but of the choisest mettalls, as are siluer and golde: and if so, what thinke we of our Soules, Gods owne Image, Gods owne superscription? had wee no other, it were, argument sufficient to procure mans excellency above all other creatures. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if <hi>St. Austins</hi> opinion, be true, that a fly, forasmuch as it hath life, farre exceeds, in digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of nature, the very sunne it selfe. And if so, what is man? how surpassing excellent is hee, that hath a reasonable soule: understanding, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, will and affections: each of them more worth then a world. Oh then, give me leave, to unfold this curious peece of Tapistrie: or, as it were, take asunder this watch: even that so yee may the better perceive the rarity of this worke, by viewing (as it were) each wheele by it selfe.</p>
            <p>As if the understanding alone were (as the whole soule) <hi>All in all, and All in every part,</hi> not onely of the body, but even of the world, it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable to consider how, mounted on the wings of contemplation, it approves a Godhead, and proves there are Angells: It discourseth of their Hierarchies: as also, of those highest spheares and their motions: of the sunne, the moone, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:177552:15"/> the starres; their number, distances, and differing paces, together with their influence: of the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Windes, Lightning, Thunder Haile, Snow, Raine, Ice, Blazing-starres, Pestilences, even as if it had had the heading of such like Gods ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, or the charging of suchlike his murdering peeces. And is not understanding alone then, worth a world, that is thus able to discourse of of more, then <hi>Ptolomy, Plato, Pliny, Plutarh,</hi> even<note place="margin">1 Kings 4. 29. 30. 31. 32. 33. &amp;c.</note>
               <hi>Salomon</hi> himselfe ever spake: and yet is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing but one part of mans Soule: which, I will not now controvert, whether it lodge in heart or in the braine chiefly. Wee are wont to to admire in great houses, at the multitude of lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings: and if so, what thinke we of the memory of man, copped up (as it were) in so small a roome, as is the conceavity of mans skull? &amp; yet how many whole volmues doth it containe: how many histories of things done before, and even since <hi>Noahs</hi> floud? how many different langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges? what a numberlesse number of words? not to speake of <hi>Methridates,</hi> as famous for his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory as his medecines: nor how <hi>Seneca</hi> was able to repeate. <hi>Pyrrhus, Cyrus, Caesar</hi> are to this day remembered for their memories: as also is hee that could easily salute every man in <hi>Rome</hi> by his own name. And is not memory alone then worth a world? and yet, is memory, but one part of mans Soule.</p>
            <p>What should I say, of the will of man? what of the power of his affections? It were idle to discourse (as Poets) of love: and as for the <hi>wrath
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:177552:15"/> of man</hi> (we know, it) <hi>worketh not the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God.</hi> I will not therefore of naturall but spirituall affections.

And if so, yet may wee behold the Sunne by reflection; even our selves in a glasse, as it were, by observing the operations of our Soules; and those sundry transcendent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of their wit.

And if so, I can assure you our soules, are much more worth than the world. Of which, ye may reade when it was lost in the Deluge;<note place="margin">Gen. 8. 1.</note> God onely remembred <hi>Noah,</hi> and the waters they returned into their severall channells.

A ransome, not of silver or gold, and yet are these two (like the sunne and the moone in the firmament) two such great Lights, as that, with their exceeding lustre, they are able to dazzle most mens eyes in the world. And yet were not silver or gold, any ransome that could bee acceped for a soule: forasmuch<note place="margin">1 Epist. 1. 18, 19</note> as <hi>Corruptible,</hi> saith <hi>St. Peter.</hi> Wherefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so were you not redeemed, with them, but by blood, even precious or honorable blood, blood of Christ: <hi>Blood of God,</hi> saith <hi>St. Paul.</hi> And<note place="margin">Acts 20. 28.</note> yet was not a drop of this bloud (as a man would have thought) sufficient: otherwise had Christ beene too prodigall in shedding it so often: even six severall time, for the redeeming of our soules: as first at his circumcision, that bloudy sacrament<note place="margin">Luke 2. 21.</note>

Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whenas that crowne of thornes was fastened to his scull. Fifthly, when as his hands and his feete they were nayled to the crosse. Sixtly and lastly, when (through that channell the Soldiours speare had made in his side) then issued forth water and bloud: or (as Anatomizers observe) his very hearts bloud. Oh! there was bloud indeed, bloud of Christ, <hi>as of a lambe without spot, and without blemish,</hi> shed<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 19.</note> a sixt time for the redemption of Soules.

Now, it is well knowne, Sathan is a Serpent, and therefore wise; an olde Serpent, and by so much the more cunning: and yet, if Christ will but commit one sinne; for those small hopes, he might have thereby to gaine one soule, how willing is the <hi>Prince of this world,</hi> to part with more<note place="margin">Iohn 12. 31.</note> than his whole Principallity? how, prodigally<note place="margin">Matth. 4. 8, 9.</note> bent, offers he unto Christ; the world, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of this world, and all their glory? So that I am now more confident, than that I should hope onely; I may now safely conclude (for this time) and say: That, for which God created the world; That, for to save which God would come into this world; That, but in hope to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase which <hi>the God of this world,</hi> would have<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 4.</note> given away his world; it must needs be, must be more worth than all this world.
